Before working on navigation on any robot first look to check the range sensors, odometry and localization. Only if these three work properly the robot navigation would.

/////  Odometry tests:
///////////////////////////

rotation test:
	1)Open up rviz set to odom frame
	2)keep the decay time of the laser scanner as high as possible
	3)perform an inplace rotation
	4)check how closely the laser scan matches the previous on subsequent rotations
	5)make sure that the scans are not off by more than a degree or two

translation test:
	1)Set up rviz with the robot a few metres away from a wall
	2)set a high decay time for the laser scans
	3)Check the thickness in the point cloud
	4)if the thickness is just a few centimeters the translation odometry is fine

Running these two tests would indicate that your odometry is fine and we could move on to the next more important aspect of robot setup
